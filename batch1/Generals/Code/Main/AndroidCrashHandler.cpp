// GeneralsX @build Android port 07/07/2026
//
// A crash during dlopen()'s ELF constructors or early in SDL_main runs
// before SDL3Main.cpp's own stderr-redirect logic ever executes — on
// stock Android that class of crash is invisible without adb (only a
// system tombstone under /data/tombstones, unreadable without root, and
// a logcat FATAL SIGNAL line that scrolls away in seconds). Users
// testing this port sideloaded, without a PC handy, had no way to tell
// us what broke.
//
// Fix: install a signal handler as an ELF constructor — it runs the
// instant the dynamic linker loads this library, before any engine code,
// before JNI_OnLoad, before main(). On a fatal signal it appends a
// one-line summary to a fixed path using only raw POSIX syscalls (no
// libc buffered I/O, no malloc) so it stays usable even with a corrupted
// heap, then chains to whatever handler was previously installed so the
// OS's own tombstone/logcat capture still happens too.
//
// The log path is the app's internal storage (getFilesDir() on the Java
// side) — always private + writable to this app's UID on every Android
// version, no permission needed, unlike external/shared storage. Android's
// SDL3/LogViewerActivity reads the same file to show it in-app without adb.

// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 18/07/2026 Interpose __cxa_throw to log the
// call stack of every C++ throw. Issue #2's crash is an exception reaching
// GameEngine::update()'s catch(...) whose typeinfo demangles to '$_0' --
// Clang's name for an ANONYMOUS type. The engine's INI status codes
// (INI_INVALID_DATA et al., Common/INI.h) are exactly that: an unnamed enum,
// so its typeinfo has internal linkage and a per-translation-unit identity,
// which is why every typed catch clause we added (including
// catch(decltype(INI_INVALID_DATA))) failed to match a throw coming from a
// different .cpp file -- the Itanium ABI compares typeinfo identity, and each
// TU has its own for an unnamed type. There are 134 `throw INI_INVALID_DATA;`
// sites, so instead of instrumenting them all, log the throw itself: since
// libmain.so is the root of its dlopen group and links libc++_shared, this
// definition preempts libc++abi's for every throw made by engine code (and
// the bundled libs in our group), records the unwind stack with dladdr
// symbol names (the engine builds with default visibility, so .dynsym keeps
// real function names even in the stripped APK), then forwards to the real
// __cxa_throw from libc++_shared so exception semantics stay untouched.
// Capped so a throw-happy code path cannot flood the log.
